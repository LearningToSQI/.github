# Learning to SQI

This organisation was started to host repositories for the following projects:

- The [SageMath implementation of SQISign](__compute_via_velu_numeric)
- The blog [Learning to SQI](https://learningtosqi.github.io/)

Our next project is to focus on $x$-only isogenies which we hope will be a useful tool for all isogenistas!
